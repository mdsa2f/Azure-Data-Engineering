# ðŸŒ¿ Azure Batch Data Pipeline for Pollen Data

This project is a practical guide aimed at a non-technical audience, demonstrating how to implement a batch data processing pipeline using Microsoft Azure. It walks through the development of an end-to-end data solution leveraging **Azure Synapse Analytics**, **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**, and **Microsoft Power BI** to process and visualize pollen data from the **Community of Madrid**.

The guide covers the full data lifecycleâ€”from periodic ingestion, processing, storage, and orchestration, to building an interactive Power BI dashboard. The infrastructure is automated using **Terraform** and integrated with **Azure DevOps** to apply modern **CI/CD practices**, ensuring efficient and reliable deployment.

The result is a custom ETL solution and dashboard that enhances the understanding and accessibility of public pollen data.
